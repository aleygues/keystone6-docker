# Keystone6 + Docker + Livereloading

This repo aims to be a starter to use Keystone6 with Docker in a live reloading mode. 

To be used, this project needs `docker` and `docker-compose` to be installed. Moreover, `yarn` or at least `npm` must be installed.

## Start to dev!

To start developping, just type `yarn docker` in your console. Then just edit some `.ts` files to see your server restarting.

Feel free to post an issue if you find some bugs.
